This is my attempt at making my own Python interpreter in Python. I made this while reading through Thornsten Ball's Writing an Interpreter with Go, in an attempt to teach myself about interpreters, especially CPython. I've had an absolute blast slowly building this up over the last few weeks, and it's completely reinvigorated my interest in completing personal projects. I leave it here for now in it's unfinished state while I start my journey into a new frontier for me, system architecture.
